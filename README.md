# Railway-Operations-Performance-Dashboard
The Railway Operations Dashboard in Power BI helps improve rail service by analyzing delays, revenue, and customer data, enabling quick, data-driven decisions to boost punctuality, revenue, and customer satisfaction.

## Project Overview
The **Railway Operations Performance Dashboard** is a Power BI solution developed to enhance operational efficiency within rail services. By aggregating and visualizing key metrics—such as delays, cancellations, revenue patterns, and customer demographics—this dashboard provides actionable insights to drive punctuality improvements, maximize revenue, and elevate customer satisfaction.

## Problem Statement
Railway services are facing operational challenges, including frequent delays, cancellations, and high refund requests. These issues are compounded by varying payment methods, ticket types, and customer demographics, resulting in inconsistent revenue and customer satisfaction. This dashboard addresses these challenges by offering a comprehensive view of performance metrics, equipping decision-makers with data to target operational improvements and boost service quality.

## Objectives
This dashboard enables railway management to:
1. **Reduce Delays and Cancellations**: Minimize disruptions by identifying and addressing root causes.
2. **Optimize Revenue**: Leverage insights on ticketing, payment methods, and station performance to drive revenue.
3. **Improve Customer Satisfaction**: Enhance service quality by understanding and addressing primary customer concerns.
4. **Enhance Resource Allocation**: Strategically deploy resources by identifying high-demand stations and routes.

## Key Features
- **Performance Metrics**: Visualize on-time arrivals, delays, cancellations, and refund requests.
- **Revenue Insights**: Breakdown of revenue by station, payment method, ticket type, and ticket class.
- **Customer Demographics**: Analyze usage across age groups, ticket types, and classes for targeted service improvements.
- **Operational Trends**: Delays analyzed by reason (e.g., weather, technical issues) and station performance metrics.

## Key Metrics
- **Total Rides**: 31,653
- **Total Revenue**: €741,921
- **On-time Performance**: 86.82%
- **Delayed/Canceled Rides**: 7.24%
- **Refund Requests**: 5.22% (€38,702)

## Insights & Recommendations
- **Station Performance**: Birmingham New Street and Liverpool Lime Street require targeted punctuality improvements.
- **Revenue Growth**: Online sales and first-class upgrades are high-potential areas for revenue enhancement.
- **Service Improvements**: Infrastructure and staffing adjustments can significantly reduce delays and cancellations.
